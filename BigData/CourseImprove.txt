This course was one of my favorite courses offered at Florida State University.

With that being said, the only thing I would recommend for improvement would be:

- More hands on experience with Amazon AWS Ec2

- More machine learning

- More hands on experience with Angular and NodeJS

- More experience with Klustering and more help with it as well

- Project could be group project

Other than that, everything else is fine and should stay the same
